<!-- Follow the following format to maintain uniformity:
 
  I [Abhushan Adhikari Joshi](https://github.com/abhu-A-J) suggests you that it's okay to make mistakes and fail miserably because with time you're only going to get better.  
-->

I [Matthew Francis](https://github.com/mafro28) always recommend backing up your work so you don't lose valuable progress!.   

I [Swayam Samyak Debasis](https://github.com/Swayamsvk) suggests you to be patient while coding and solving issues to get better results.   

I [Meghna]() would recomment you to join the dev community, attend meetups in order to meet like-minded people who'll keep you inspired and motivating.

I [Nisheanthan](https://github.com/Nisheanthan) I will say that you should never be afraid to learn while start coding. Yes, It's hard but it once if you start singing, you will hear yourself amazing in coding. Happy Coding.
